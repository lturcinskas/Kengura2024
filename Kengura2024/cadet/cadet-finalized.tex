{60 cm}{68 cm}{78 cm}{88 cm}{90 cm}
{C}{0}
{The difference in length between 4 trolleys and 10 trolleys equals $60\,\mathrm{cm}$. Adding $10-4=6$ trolleys means adding 60 cm. So, adding one extra trolley means adding $60\,\mathrm{cm}:6=10\,\mathrm{cm}$  of length. This means that four trolleys minus the extra length of three trolleys $= 108\,\mathrm{cm} - 3 \times 10\,\mathrm{cm} =78\,\mathrm{cm}$. So the length of one trolley is $78\,\mathrm{cm}$.
\newline Alternative solution
\newline
Let the length of one trolley equal $x\, \mathrm{cm}$ and let the left part of the first (from left) trolley, which is not covered by other trolleys, equal $y\, \mathrm{cm}$. The length of a set of four well-parked trolleys consists of three parts y of the first three trolleys and the length $x$ of the forth trolley. Thus, $3y+x=108$. Analogously, for ten trolleys we have $9y+x=168$. It follows that $6y=168-160= 60$ and $y=10\,\mathrm{cm}$. The length of one trolley is equal to $x=108-3y=78 \,\mathrm{cm}$.}}

{Let $u$ denote the number of uphill jumps and $d$ the number of downhill jumps.  Since the kangaroo covers three times the distance with each downhill jump as it does with each uphill jump, it will make three times as many uphill jumps as it does downhill jumps.  Therefore $u = 3d$.  Since we are told that $u + d = 2024$, we have $3d + d = 2024$ which has solution $d = 506$.

{60}{70}{75}{80}{85}
{C}{0}
{Consider 100 grams of fresh mushrooms.  Since 80 \% of this is water, the remainder has a mass of 20 grams.  When dried, this 20 grams now represents 80\% of the total mass and so the 20\% that is water has a mass of 5 grams.  Therefore the total mass of the dried mushrooms is 25 grams and hence the decrease is 75 grams or 75\% of the original mass.  
\newline Algebraic Solution: \newline
Let the mass of the water in the dried mushrooms be $X$ grams.  Since this represents 20\% of the total mass, the mass of the remainder four times as much and so is $4X$ grams.  However, this $4X$ grams represents only 20\% of the mass of fresh mushrooms and hence the mass of water in the fresh mushrooms is four times as much and so is $16X$ grams.  Therefore the percentage decrease in the mass is $\dfrac{(16X + 4X) - (4X + X)}{(16X + 4X)} \times 100 = \dfrac{15X}{20X} \times 100 = 75$}

However, the first option is not possible since only 0 has two horizontal segments.

Therefore there must be 3, 2, and 0 horizontal segments in the digits. Only digit 1 has no horizontal segments and only digit 0 has two horizontal segments and they have six vertical segments between them.

{Fi had a total of $4 + 6 + 12 + 13 + 22 + 29 = 86$ eggs. After selling one basket, Fi notices that the number of chicken eggs she has left is twice the number of duck eggs.  Hence, the total number of eggs she has left is a multiple of 3.   Since 86 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, the number of eggs she sold also has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.  Of the numbers of eggs in the different baskets, only 29 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.  Hence the customer bought 29 eggs.}

\Problem{Captain Flint asked four of his pirates to write on a piece of paper how many gold, silver and bronze coins were in the treasure chest.  Their responses are shown in the diagram but unfortunately part of the paper was damaged. Only one of the four pirates told the truth. The other three lied in all their answers.  The total number of coins is 30.  Who told the truth?

{Suppose Tom told the truth.  Then, since the total number of coins is 30, his response for gold coins would be $30-9-11 = 10$.  However, this is the same as Pit's response for gold coins and since the three pirates who lied, lied in all three of there answers, this is not possible.\newline
Now suppose Pit told the truth.  His response for silver coins would be $30-10-10 = 10$ but this is the same as Jim's response and so is not possible. \newline
Next suppose Jim told the truth.  His response for bronze coins would be 11 but this is the same as Tom's response and so is not possible.\newline
Therefore, since none of Tom, Pit or Jim told the truth, only Al can have told the truth.  His missing response for silver coins would be 11 and it can be seen that none of his answers match any of the other pirate's answers.}

\Problem{Alex drives from point $A$ to point $B$, then immediately returns to $A$.  Bob drives from point $B$ to point $A$, then immediately returns to $B$.  They travel on the same road, start at the same time and each travels at a constant speed.   Alex's speed is three times Bob's speed. They pass each other for the first time 15 minutes after the start. How long after the start will they pass each other for the second time?}

{Let $v_A$ and $v_B$ be Alex's speed and Bob's speed respectively. Assume boys meet for the first time in point $M$. Since $v_A=3v_B$, then $AM=3  BM$. Each boy covered his distance in 15 min. Since $v_A/v_B >2$, the second meeting took place before Bob reached $A$, assume in point $N$. Between meetings, Alex covered the distance $MB+BM+MN$, Bob covered the distance $MN$. Since $MB+BM+MN=3   MN$, we have $MB=MN$. Thus, Bob covered from the start till the second meeting the distance $BM+MN=2  BM$ in $2 \times 15=30$ min.}

\Problem{In the pentagon $ABCDE$, $\angle A =\angle B = 90^\circ$, $AE = BC$ and $ED = DC$.  Four points are marked on $AB$ dividing it into five equal parts. Then perpendiculars are drawn through these points, as shown in the diagram. The dark shaded region has an area of 13 cm$^2$ and the light shaded region has an area of 10 cm$^2$.  What is the area, in cm$^2$, of the entire pentagon?}

{Since $\angle A =\angle B=90^\circ $ and $AE=BC$, $ABCE$ is a rectangle. If P is midpoint of  $AB$, the pentagon $ABCDE$ is axisymmetric. \includegraphics{C30-1}
\newline Draw the lines $FG$, $HI$ and $JK$ these are parallel to $AB$.
Lets look at the areas of the given figures:
\newline \includegraphics{C30-2} \includegraphics{C30-3} \includegraphics{C30-4} \includegraphics{C30-5}
\newline So, the area of the pentagon $= 2 \times (4+2) + 2 \times 10 + 13= 45$.}}
