{When the shapes overlap, the hexagons remain in the top left and bottom right corners. Also the triangles remain in the top right and bottom left corners.  This eliminates choices (D) and (E). Next we can eliminate choice (B) because the shape in the centre is inverted. Looking more closely at choice (C), we notice that the triangle in the top right corner is inverted. That leaves us with choice (A).}

{The smallest possible answer he can get is $1 + 2 = 3$ and the largest is $4 + 5 = 9$. All the other numbers he can get are in between those two. In other words, all possible numbers he can get are definitely among 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In fact he can get all these numbers as seen from the calculations $1 + 2 = 3$; $1 + 3 = 4$; $1 + 4 = 5$; $2 + 4 = 6$; $3 + 4 = 7$; $3 + 5 = 8$; $4 + 5 = 9$.  Counting them we see that he can get 7 possible different results.

=== alternative solution ===
Writing out the possible sums in order:
$1 + 2 = 3$;
$1 + 3 = 4$;
$1 + 4 = 5$;
$1 + 5 = 6$;
$2 + 3 = 5$;
$2 + 4 = 6$;
$2 + 5 = 7$;
$3 + 4 = 7$;
$3 + 5 = 8$;
$4 + 5 = 9$.
We get 10 sums overall but 3 of them have equal answers, so we can get 7 different answers.}

If we compare the first and third tower, we find that the triangle is 5 units high ($20 - 15 = 5$). Now, if we compare the second and third tower, we find that the rectangle is 7 units high. ($20 - 13 = 7$).
The tower made from a rectangle and a triangle is therefore $12 = 7 + 5$ units high.}
