{Dan marked every $1/12$ piece of paper (used 11 points). 
Muhammad marked every $1/16$ piece of paper (used 15 points). 
They have 3 common points: $3/12=4/16$, $6/12=8/16$, $9/12=12/16$.
Then in total, Maya had $11+15-3=23$ points to cut and hence 24 pieces of paper.}

\Problem{Emma is playing with the seven caterpillar puzzle pieces shown.\newline
\centerline{\includegraphics{B29-1}}\newline
She wants to build a caterpillar that has one head, one tail and either one, two or three puzzle pieces in between.
How many different caterpillars could Emma build?}

{E}{0}
{There are 4 possibilities to choose the head and the tail, and then there are always the same 5 possibilities for the inner puzzle pieces.
Altogether there are $4 \cdot 5 = 20$ possibilities.\newline

\Problem{Ava writes a three-digit number on the whiteboard. Then Brandon writes a fourth digit to the right of the previous ones. He says ``Look! The number increased by 2024''. What digit did Brandon write?}

{Ava writes the number abc. Brandon writes the number abcd. Number abcd increased number abc by 2024, that means, that $abcd - abc = 2024$. The digit a therefore has to have the value 2. This leads to digit b, which also has the value 2. To get 2024 the digit d has to be 8 and the digit c has to have the value 4. Brandon therefore writes the digit 8 as fourth digit on the right of the previous one. $2248 - 224 = 2024$.}
