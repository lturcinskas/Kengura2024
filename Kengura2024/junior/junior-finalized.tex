\Problem{Ali wants to remove some of the integers from 1 to 25 and then separate the remaining numbers into two groups 
so that the products of the integers in each group are equal. What is the smallest number of integers Ali could remove?}
{4}{5}{6}{7}{8}
{B}{0}
{Thinking of the prime factorizations of the products of the numbers of both groups, they have to be the same, since the products are equal. Therefore, prime numbers that have only one multiple among the numbers from 1 to 25 have to be removed. These prime numbers are 13, 17, 19 and 23. 7 has three multiples among the numbers from 1 to 25: 7, 14 and 21. At least one of them must be removed, which works only with the deletion of 7. The remaining 20 numbers can be split in two groups that have equal product. 
\newline
For example:
$$3\cdot5\cdot8\cdot14\cdot15\cdot18\cdot20\cdot22\cdot24=2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot9\cdot10\cdot11\cdot12\cdot16\cdot21\cdot25=2^{11}\cdot3^{5}\cdot5^3\cdot7\cdot11.$$}

\Problem{Twenty points are equally spaced on the circumference of a circle. 
David draws all the possible chords that connect pairs of these points.  How many of these chords are longer than the radius of the circle but shorter than its diameter?}
{90}{100}{120}{140}{160}
{C}{0}
{\includegraphics[scale=1.2]{J28-1}\newline
Each of the 20 points is connected with the 19 other points on the circumference, forming 19 chords. One of these 19 chords is exactly equal to the diameter, leaving 18 chords to consider. 
\newline
For a chord to be larger than the radius, its central angle has to be larger than $60^\circ$.
\newline
Since the 20 points form a regular 20-gon, the central angle of the chord connecting two adjacent points is $360/20=18^\circ$. Therefore, we need at least 4 central angles ($3\cdot18^\circ=54^\circ<60^\circ$). 
\newline
That is, 3 pairs of chords from a point to its three nearest points along the circumference (on either side) are going to be shorter than the radius. This leaves us with 6 pairs of chords, or 12 chords per point. Since each chord is counted twice (once per endpoint) the total number of chords satisfying the condition is $(20\cdot 12) : 2 = 120$.}

\Problem{There are $n$ distinct lines on the plane, labeled $\ell_1, \dots, \ell_n$. The line $\ell_1$ intersects exactly $5$ other lines, the line $\ell_2$ intersects exactly $9$ other lines, and the line $\ell_3$ intersects exactly $11$ other lines. 
Which of the following is a smallest possible value of $n$?}
{11}{12}{13}{14}{15}
{B}{0}
{Since one of the lines intersects 11 other lines, the minimum number of lines is 12. On the other hand, taking a family of 7 parallel lines, another family of 3 parallel lines perpendicular to the first family and two other lines, intersecting each other and intersecting both families of parallel lines, we have an arrangement of lines that conforms to the requirement. Any of the lines in the first family of 7 parallel lines can be $\ell_1$, as it intersects 5 other lines. Any of the lines in the second family of 3 parallel lines can be $\ell_2$ as it intersects 9 other lines. Finally, any of the last two lines can be $\ell_3$ as it intersects 11 other lines. Therefore, the answer is 12.

\Problem{Suppose $m$ and $n$ are integers with $0<m<n$. Let $P=(m, n)$, $Q=(n, m)$, and $O=(0,0)$. For how many pairs of $m$ and $n$ will the area of triangle $OPQ$ be equal to 2024?}
{4}{6}{8}{10}{12}
{B}{0}
{$A_{\triangle OPQ}= n^{2}-mn-\frac{1}{2}(n-m)^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(n^{2}-m^{2}) = 2024 \implies (n+m)(n-m)=4048$. \newline
Since $m$ and $n$ are both integers $n+m$ and $n-m$ are both even or both odd. \newline
There are six ways that $4048=2^4\cdot 11\cdot 23$ can be represented as a product of two even numbers: $2\times 2024$, $2^2 \times 1012$, $2^3 \times 506$, $(2\cdot 11) \times (2^3\cdot 23)$, $(2^2\cdot 11)\times (2^2\cdot 23)$, $(2\cdot 23) \times(2^3\cdot 11)$, so there are 6 possible pairs of $(n,m): \{(1013, 1011),(508, 504),(257,249),(103,81),(68,24),(67,21)\}$.}}
