{We have $p(1) + p(6) = 1 - 4 \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and $p(6) = 2 \cdot p(1)$.

Since we are told that $p < q$ and the sum of the coefficients of $p$ and $q$ in each expression is the same, the largest expression is the one with the largest coefficient of $q$.

{If $a$ is one of the roots we can choose $x$ so that $20-x=a$, that is, $x=20-a$.  This gives $f(a)= f(42-a)$. So $42-a$ is also a root. Hence, the sum of the roots is $a+(42-a)= 42$. 
\newline Note that $42-a$ is definitely a different root because suppose $a=42-a$, so $a=21$. If $b$ is the second root mentioned in the problem, so $b \ne 21$, then by the above $42-b$ is also a root. But as $b \ne 42 -b $ (because $b\ne 21$), the equation would have three distinct roots, $a, b, 42-b$ contrary to assumption. 
Hence $a$ and $42-a$ are distinct. 
\newline
Another way to solve the problem is to use symmetry: The given equation can be written as $f(21-t)=f(21+t)$. So the line $x=21$ is an axis of symmetry of the graph of $f$.  The result follows from this.}

\Problem{Twelve points are equally spaced on a circle.  How many triangles containing a $45^\circ$ angle can be formed by choosing three of these points?}
{$48$}{$60$}{$72$}{$84$}{$96$}
{D}{0}
{An angle of $45^\circ$ is created by a line subtended by two points
  spaced three apart. For any given base arc three points apart, there
  are 8 positions for the third vertex of the triangle.  So we have $12
  \times 8=96$ possible triangles.  However, any isosceles triangles
  will be counted twice and there are 12 of these, so the total of
  different triangles is $96 - 12 = 84$}

\Problem{A special four-digit number $\overline{abcd}$ satisfies the equation $\overline{abcd} = a^{a}+b^b+c^c+d^d$.
What is the value of $a$?}
{$2$}{$3$}{$4$}{$5$}{$6$}
{B}{0}
{Estimation shows that $6^6 > 10000$, $4^4=256$ so we cannot have a 6 or more as one of the digits, but without the 5 the right hand side won't be larger than 1000, so among $a,b,c,d$ there should be exactly one 5, that makes $a=3$ since $5^5=3125$.
The special number is $3435$.}
